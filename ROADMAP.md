# Chicken Clicker - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the future development phases for Chicken Clicker, transitioning from a simple idle game into a feature-rich, interactive experience.

## **Phase 1: The "Alive" Update (v3.1)**
**Focus:** Interactive World Events & Dynamic Gameplay.
*   **The Eagle Attack:**
    *   *Concept:* A predator flies across the screen. Player must click it to scare it away.
    *   *Reference:* Duck Hunt style.
    *   *Failure State:* Temporarily reduces EPS or steals eggs.
    *   *Easter Egg:* If the Eagle wins, a pixel-art dog laughs from the grass.
*   **The Fox in the Bush:**
    *   *Concept:* Glowing eyes appear randomly in background assets.
    *   *Mechanic:* Subtle visual cue; requires player observation. Clicking rewards bonus loot.
*   **Weather Systems:**
    *   *Concept:* Visual rain/storm overlays that provide passive buffs/debuffs (e.g., "Wet Soil" spawns more worms).

## **Phase 2: The "Collector" Update (v3.2)**
**Focus:** Lore, Collections, and Customization.
*   **Museum of Antiquities:**
    *   *Concept:* A new modal to display "Artifacts" dug up during gameplay.
    *   *Lore:* Descriptions provide backstory about the "Ancestral Farmer."
    *   *Buffs:* Artifacts provide small, permanent passive bonuses.
*   **Genetic Engineering (Skins):**
    *   *Concept:* Combine chicken breeds to create custom skins for the main clicker chicken.
    *   *Example:* Silkie + Robot = "Cyber-Fluff".

## **Phase 3: The "Cosmic" Expansion (v3.3)**
**Focus:** Deep Endgame & Spatial Expansion.
*   **The Lunar Coop:**
    *   *Concept:* A second "Prestige Layer" situated on the Moon.
    *   *Toggle:* Switch the entire scene view between "Earth" and "Moon."
    *   *Currency:* "Moon Rocks" or "Dark Matter" with separate upgrades.
*   **Physics Change:** Low-gravity floating numbers in the Moon view.
